\section{Introduction}
Globalization is an economical and societal trend that has pushed industries to move from local to global markets.
Working in a global setting requires practitioners to work in distributed arrangements.

Paraphrasing Herbsleb \footnote{Herbsleb, James D. (2007). Global Software Engineering: The Future of Socio-technical Coordination}, many of the mechanisms that work correctly in a co-located setting are absent or disrupted in a distributed arrangement.
Different approaches have been investigated to improve the awareness of the working context that a member of a virtual team has; nonetheless, information like the presence of virtual team members, trivial in a co-located setting, represent an interesting open area of investigation.
% TODO hvem har sagt ovenst√•ende? Er det fra Herbsleb? Tror vi skal specificere lidt mere end bare skrive different approaches have been investigated.

One fundamental difference between a co-located arrangement and a distributed one is the lack of presence awareness.
The ability to assess how interruptible another person is, becomes very hard when you are not in the same room.
When you are in the near proximity of another person it is fairly easy to guess the interruptibility of that person.
We use the interruptibility assessment to facility behavior that we consider socially acceptable.
If you are in a distributed setting you are dependent on tool support from computer and communication systems.
These systems are largely unaware of the social contracts of human interactions.

Research by the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University \cite{Fogarty:2005:PHI:1057237.1057243} shows that you can detect the interruptibility of a person using sensor inputs.
In their research they find that you can predict interruptibility with sensor inputs to an accuracy of 68\%.
The researchers note that their results could ``motivate the development of systems that use these models to negotiate interruptions at socially appropriate times.''

We will try to build upon the research done by Fogarty etc.
The work presented in this paper represents two primary contributions.
First, we demonstrate an implementation of a presence and interruptibility-sharing infrastructure for global software engineers.
Second, we demonstrate a possible application. This is used to test and evaluate the infrastructure by implementing enough sensors to provide accurate interruptibility information.

\section{Technical Implementation}
\subsection{Infrastructure}
Each user typically has several sensor inputs.
The system needs to be highly scalable to support a large number of users.

To support the scalability needs we will use the actor model by Carl Hewitt \cite{hewitt1973universal}.
The actor model is a way to model computer programs where everything is split up into the smallest possible unit of work.
These units of work are encapsulated in the actor abstraction.
Actors communicate by sending messages to each other.
Actors does not share any state, making it possible to run actors in parallel and even on different machines.
This makes the actor model a good candidate for building highly scalable applications.

There are several frameworks implementing the actor model, such as Akka\cite{akka}, Project Orleans\cite{orleans} and most famously Erlang\cite{erlang}.
For this project we have chosen Akka because it is Java based.
This supports the technical knowledge in our group.

We use the general programming language Scala\cite{scala} to program our Akka-based infrastructure.
