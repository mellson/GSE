\section{Background}

Nowadays, globalization is an economical and societal trend that has pushed industries to move from local to global markets requiring practitioners to work more and more in distributed arrangements.  However, this rapid shift of practice has not been followed timely by organizational changes. In fact, a fundamental difference between a co-located arrangement and a distributed one is represented by the lack of physical presence.  Often underestimated, this intrinsic characteristic has severe repercussions, which need to be properly addressed for the distributed cooperation to succeed.
Paraphrasing Herbsleb \footnote{Herbsleb, James D. (2007). Global Software Engineering: The Future of Socio-technical Coordination}, many of the mechanisms that function in a co-located setting are absent or disrupted in a distributed project. Different approaches have been investigated to improve the awareness of the working context that a member of a virtual team has; nonetheless, information like the presence of virtual team members, trivial in a co-located setting, represent an interesting open area of investigation.

\section{Idea}

We wish to create a presence information infrastructure for global software engineers. The central idea behind the project is focused on proposing a solution to the context awareness problem described in the background. Our initial conceptualization of a possible implementation of such solution considers a modular system able to gather presence information from inputs sources (sensors).
The data gathered and aggregated through the sensors would then be exposed by the system via REST APIs.
The system needs to be highly scalable to support many users.
For this reason we will create a system based on the Actor model by Carl Hewitt \footnote{Carl Hewitt; Peter Bishop; Richard Steiger (1973). A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence}.
We will create a minimum of 2 demonstrators leveraging the APIs provided by the infrastructure to showcase possible applications.

\section{Scenario}
The target group which will be used to drive our development is a typical danish SME whose core business is software development.
Robocat is located in central Copenhagen and comprises 11 employees.
Among these, 7 work in the Copenhagen office, 2 in Aarhus, and 2 in San Francisco.

Due to the distributed nature of the company it is very hard to gain an overview of the people present at work and whether their presence is in the office or somewhere else. Workers are teamed up on projects that span multiple locations and often need to coordinate ad hoc meetings.

In this scenario the collective knowledge about coworkers presence could alleviate some of the issues that occur from the global distribution of teams. The teams could use our infrastructure to collect presence about all workers and feed it to demonstrators that would help the team to gain better insights into the collective status of the team. The sensors that detect their presence are feeding the infrastructure with information through the REST API, describing their individual situation.

Among the sensors and mechanisms that will be considered and might be included in the system, we envision:
\begin{itemize}
\item The proximity of a team members phone to their work computer.
\item An application installed on the team members computer that detects work-related activities.
\item A camera monitoring movement patterns in the room where the work is executed.
\item A heat sensor/thermal camera detecting movement in the work area.
\item A pressure plate on the team members chair.
\item A RFID chip that the team member must log in with.
\item A bot logged in to the teams work chat room watching team members on-line status
\end{itemize}

Each of the team members could have an application on their workstation (one of the demonstrators), exposing availability information of the other team members. The program calls the service through the REST API and retrieves information about the other team members. Based on this information, it determines whether each team member is present and available. Examples of demonstrators in this scenario could be:

\begin{itemize}
\item An application installed on the team members mobile device that displays the status of all team members.
\item USB toy figures conveying presence information of team members.
\item A service that detects when the team member tries to contact another team member. The service will then inform the interrupter about the status of the interruptee.
\item An application that can visualize presence information over time and use it for statistical purposes.
\item A large wall mounted display that can convey information about many team members.
\end{itemize}

All of this information can be accessed by anyone within the company, and can be used to get a quick overview of how the companys resources are being used. It can also be used by a developer inside the company to see where another employee in charge of a given area is currently located and if that person is busy.

\section{Requirements}

Server for the infrastructure. We will use Azure, Digital Ocean or similar.
Sensors for the presence information gathering. We will consider using some of the following; smart-phones, heat sensors, cameras, microphones, RFID sensors, pressure sensors, software sensors.
The infrastructure should be able to handle data coming from multiple sources even when carrying conflicting information.
Demonstrators showcasing the infrastructure. Such as mobile devices, screens, holographic displays, speakers, indicator lights, wall-mounted displays.

\section{Foreseen Outcome}

The outcome of this project will end up with the following products.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (prototype) infrastructure. The server software system supporting the entire project
\item (prototype) REST APIs. The software exposing the functionalities provided by 1.
\item (prototype) demonstrators e.g. actuators that uses the information from the infrastructure.
\item (report) infrastructure design. Internal document detailing all design decisions, diagrams, etc related to 1. This document will be used during the execution of 1 to collect all the requirements and create the design of the infrastructure
\item (report) APIs documentation. Formal documentation of the functionalities of 1. exposed
\item (report) input sources. Internal document capturing all the discussions including rationale related to the HW/SW considered for sensing the presence.  The document will contain also a summarizing matrix.
\item (handout) final report. Formal document for the course in the format of a Ubicomp paper.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Risk management}

If we run into an unexpected complication we have assessed that the minimum work we will hand in is the infrastructure prototype and the Ubicomp report.

\section{Logistic}

\begin{itemize}
\item We have a weekly meeting on every Tuesday. During this meeting:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Every team member is available on Slack and Skype.
    \item We discuss the work progress during the last week.
    \item Assess when we have the need for an alignment meeting with our supervisor.
    \item Follow up on the schedule.
    \end{itemize}
\item We have a shared folder on Google Drive which is accessible by team members and the supervisor.
\item We use GitHub to version and ensure our prototypes and report.
\end{itemize}
